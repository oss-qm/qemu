Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends},
Description: extra block backend modules for qemu-system and qemu-utils
 QEMU is a fast processor emulator: currently the package supports
 ARM, CRIS, i386, M68k (ColdFire), MicroBlaze, MIPS, PowerPC, SH4,
 SPARC and x86-64 emulation. By using dynamic translation it achieves
 reasonable speed while being easy to port on new host CPUs.
 .
 This package provides extra block device backend modules for qemu-system
 emulation and qemu-img from qemu-utils package, which are rarely used and
 has extra dependencies.

Description: QEMU full system emulation binaries (arm)
 QEMU is a fast processor emulator: currently the package supports
 ARM emulation. By using dynamic translation it achieves
 reasonable speed while being easy to port on new host CPUs.
 .
 This package provides the full system emulation binaries to emulate
 the following arm hardware: ${sysarch:arm}.
 .
 In system emulation mode QEMU emulates a full system, including a processor
 and various peripherals.  It enables easier testing and debugging of system
 code.  It can also be used to provide virtual hosting of several virtual
 machines on a single server.

Description: QEMU user mode emulation binaries
 QEMU is a fast processor emulator: currently the package supports
 ARM, CRIS, i386, M68k (ColdFire), MicroBlaze, MIPS, PowerPC, SH4,
 SPARC and x86-64 emulation. By using dynamic translation it achieves
 reasonable speed while being easy to port on new host CPUs.
 .
 This package provides the user mode emulation binaries. In this mode
 QEMU can launch Linux processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU.
 .
 If qemu-user-binfmt package is also installed, it will register binary
 format handlers from this qemu-user package with the kernel so it will
 be possible to run foreign binaries directly.  However, this might not
 be suitable for using inside foreign chroots, in which case it is
 possible to use qemu-user-static package instead of qemu-user-binmft, --
 qemu-user-static will register statically linked binfmt handlers instead.

Description: QEMU utilities
 QEMU is a fast processor emulator: currently the package supports

 SPARC and x86-64 emulation. By using dynamic translation it achieves
 reasonable speed while being easy to port on new host CPUs.

 This package provides QEMU related utilities:
  * qemu-img: QEMU disk image utility
  * qemu-io:  QEMU disk exerciser
  * qemu-nbd: QEMU disk network block device server

Description: Guest-side qemu-system agent
 QEMU is a fast processor emulator: currently the package supports
 ARM, CRIS, i386, M68k (ColdFire), MicroBlaze, MIPS, PowerPC, SH4,
 SPARC and x86-64 emulation. By using dynamic translation it achieves
 reasonable speed while being easy to port on new host CPUs.
 .
 This package provides a daemon (agent) to run inside qemu-system
 guests (full system emulation).  It communicates with the host using
 a virtio-serial channel org.qemu.guest_agent.0, and allows one to perform
 some functions in the guest from the host, including:
  - querying and setting guest system time
  - performing guest filesystem sync operation
  - initiating guest shutdown or suspend to ram
  - accessing guest files
  - freezing/thawing guest filesystem operations
  - others.
 .
 Install this package on a system which is running as guest inside
 qemu virtual machine.  It is not used on the host.
